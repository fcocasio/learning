Starfish & Coffee

**BODY**
It's 7:45 
we're all in line
to greet the teacher
Ms. Kathleen

First was Kevin
Then came Luci
Third in line was 
me

All of us 
were ordinary
compared to 
Cynthia Rose

She always stood
at the back of the line
a smile beneath her 
nose

Her favorite number was 20

and every single day

if you ask her

what she had for breakfast

this is what she'd say



starfish and coffee

maple syrup and jam

a butterscotch cloud

a tangerine

a side order of ham


if you set your mind free , baby

maybe you'd understand

starfish and coffee

maple syrup and jam.
